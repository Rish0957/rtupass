						RTU Pass is basically just an Idea which revolves around making engineering easier than ever. What we offer is exactly what a B.Tech Student is looking for. We provide notes for every subject you will encounter while in B.Tech. We provide previous year exam papers of last 5 years , seems sufficient enough to score good in semesters. Plus, one last and most important thing We provide is Laboratory Manuals and files. We all look for somebody else to complete the work, in class,so that we can copy and complete our lab file/assignments. But hey,why to worry when RTU Pass provides it all at one place RTU Pass
						Who doesn't want an "All Clear" tag ? ofcourse, everyone...and for that purpose,the RTU Pass Team is working harder to bring good quality notes,previous year question papers , lab files for you.
						<br/><br/>
						Why are we doing this??<br/>
						In the year 2013 Almost 50% of students fail to clear one or more exam in each and every semester. That year, 32,950 students appeared in the first semester exam of which 13,704 managed to clear all the papers. Around 58% students moved to the next semester without clearing one or more paper.

						That was the story of one single year.So, we people did a little research on "cracking the semester with ease". And here we are , with this whole new idea . Now with RTU Pass in your Bookmarks bar ,it would be easier for you to collect all the resources you need,i.e, form notes to books and from previous year exam papers to lab files.

					<p>Nobody can deny that studying from notes is always preferable to studying from books. That black text and monotonous tone makes a book quite dull and boring. On the other hand, hand written Notes are comparatively more Interactive and precise in Nature. But most of us have always hated the idea of making dozen of notes copies in school, Right ? And it gets even more tiresome in college…  Because the classes are irregular, if not the classes, We Are. And IF (that’s a big IF) somehow you overcome this hurdle, the syllabus doesn’t finish in time!<br/>
So what to do ? what is the solution to this problem ? The Solution is RTU PASS. Here we Provide quality notes written by some Sincere studious students. Notes of all Branches and subjects are made available in a systematic order in this section.

						What’s the best possible scenario for scoring good in any exam ? it’s when you already know the questions being asked beforehand. But isn’t that too much to ask, you’d wonder. Not in the case of RTU semester exams because the questions are repetitive. RTU tends to stick to it’s Favourite Questions and keeps asking them. And we want you to take maximum benefit out of it. Going through these previous years papers can help you get a decent idea of most probable questions. In fact, as you can predict more than half of the paper. Also you can strategize your exam preparation according to the format of the paper. You all know how important it is to get familiar with the paper pattern. It builds self confidence and works like an antidote for exam anxiety.  <br/>

						As you all know Out of the total 1000 marks in a semester, Semester Exams and Mid terms combined are allotted 600 marks. that’s 60% of it, and we have provided notes & Previous years papers for that. But still 40% is too big a share to ignore. A part of this 40% is allotted to your Lab Files. So, it’s fair to say that Lab Files can affect your semester percentage. Most of us wait for someone else to finish the Lab files so we can copy from it. So, Here’s the thing, You can count on us to provide you with all the Lab files you need. A correctly made lab file checked on time can give you that extra edge over others. Now Let me tell you why relying on RTU PASS is better than depending on your classmates. You don’t have to wait for them to finish it first. You don’t have to ask different people for different files, we have all of them at one place. Isn’t that great ? What’s more, RTU PASS will never tell you “I’ve given it to someone else” or make silly excuses like that just to avoid you. You have our word on that!
