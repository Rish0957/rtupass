## PS : This is just a front end design. If you have the content like previous year papers or something like that which you want to share, bravo!, feel free to use. Start by forking this project to your directory.

RTU Pass is basically just an Idea which revolves around making engineering easier than ever. What we offer is exactly what a B.Tech Student is looking for. We provide notes for every subject you will encounter while in B.Tech. We provide previous year exam papers of last 5 years , seems sufficient enough to score good in semesters. Plus, one last and most important thing We provide is Laboratory Manuals and files. We all look for somebody else to complete the work, in class,so that we can copy and complete our lab file/assignments. But hey,why to worry when RTU Pass provides it all at one place RTU Pass Who doesn't want an "All Clear" tag ? ofcourse, everyone...and for that purpose,the RTU Pass Team is working harder to bring good quality notes,previous year question papers , lab files for you.
